# IMS3

With this MAX patch the performer will be able to create interesting performances with the help of the computer. While he plays, the machine will listen for 3 types of chords and this will generate a melody. He can adjust the speed from the tempo object and also the lenght from the counter object. Inspired by Hearing Glasses modal melody generator.
